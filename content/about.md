{{ resize_image(path="images/lijun.jpg", width=400, op="fit_width", alt="Lijun Profile Picture") }}

Starting in 2025, I serve as Director of Computer Vision on Sam's In-Club Tech at [Walmart Global Tech](https://tech.walmart.com/content/walmart-global-tech/en_us.html).
Previously, from 2022 to 2025, I was a Manager of Machine Learning
on the Sam's AI Labs at [Walmart Global Tech](https://tech.walmart.com/content/walmart-global-tech/en_us.html) where my teams created and maintained the time series forecasting platform for
finance, merchandising, supply chain, and in-store operation within Walmart. 
Formerly, I was a team lead of algorithm in the machine learning research group
at [Texas Instruments](https://www.ti.com/), drawing upon my Ph.D. research and
years of experience on machine learning platforms to help TI do
hardware-software co-design for machine learning acceleration chips and serve 
our customers with chip-specific model training platforms.
