# About

<img src="lijun.jpg" alt="Lijun Zhu Profile" width="400"/>

Starting in 2022, I served as senior manage of data science and machine learning
on the Sam's AI Lab at [Walmart Global Tech](https://tech.walmart.com/content/walmart-global-tech/en_us.html)
where my teams create and maintain the time series forecasting platform for
finance, merchandising, supply chain, and in-store operation within Walmart. 
Formerly, I was a team lead of algorithm in the machine learning research group
at [Texas Instruments](https://www.ti.com/), drawing upon my Ph.D. research and
years of experience on machine learning platforms to help TI do
hardware-software co-design for machine learning acceleration chips and serve 
our customers with chip-specific model training platforms.
